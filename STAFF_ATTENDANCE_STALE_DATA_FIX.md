# Staff Attendance Screen Bug Fix

## Problem Description
The staff attendance screen (`lib/screens/staff_attendance_screen.dart`) was displaying stale attendance data from previous sessions instead of showing a fresh, empty slate for the current day. This happened because the attendance map was initialized with all students marked as present (`true`) by default, without checking for existing attendance records for the selected date.

## Root Cause
In the `_loadStudents()` method (line ~115), the attendance map was hardcoded to initialize all students as present:

```dart
attendance = {
  for (var s in students) s['registration_no'] as String: true,
};
```

This meant that:
1. Faculty would see yesterday's data (all present) when starting fresh today
2. No check was made for existing attendance records for the current date
3. The screen didn't differentiate between "not yet marked" and "marked as present"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New Method to Attendance Service
Created `getExistingAttendanceMap()` method in `lib/services/attendance_service.dart` that:
- Fetches existing attendance records for a specific date, department, semester, and section
- Supports both daily attendance and period-based attendance modes
- Returns a map of registration numbers to attendance status (bool)
- Handles cases where no attendance records exist yet

### 2. Modified Staff Attendance Screen Initialization
Updated `_loadStudents()` method in `lib/screens/staff_attendance_screen.dart` to:
- Load existing attendance data for the selected date before initializing the attendance map
- Default students to `false` (absent) if no existing record is found, rather than `true` (present)
- Use actual attendance data when available

### 3. Added Dynamic Reloading
Enhanced the screen to reload fresh attendance data when:
- **Date changes**: When faculty selects a different date via date picker
- **Mode changes**: When switching between daily and period attendance modes
- **Subject changes**: When selecting a different subject in period mode
- **Period changes**: When selecting a different period in period mode

### 4. Fixed Initialization Logic
Changed attendance map initialization from:
```dart
// OLD (buggy)
attendance = {
  for (var s in students) s['registration_no'] as String: true,
};
```

To:
```dart
// NEW (fixed)
attendance = {
  for (var s in students) 
    s['registration_no'] as String: 
      existingAttendance[s['registration_no'] as String] ?? false,
};
```

## Files Modified

### `lib/services/attendance_service.dart`
- Added `getExistingAttendanceMap()` method
- Fixed unused parameter warning in `_calculateDepartmentSummaryFallback()`

### `lib/screens/staff_attendance_screen.dart`
- Modified `_loadStudents()` to check existing attendance data
- Added `_loadStudents()` calls to date selection handler
- Added `_loadStudents()` calls to mode toggle handlers  
- Added `_loadStudents()` calls to subject/period selection handlers

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Fresh Sessions**: When faculty opens the attendance screen for the current day, all students show as absent (unmarked) by default
2. **Existing Data**: If attendance has already been taken for the selected date, the screen shows the actual recorded attendance status
3. **Date Changes**: Selecting a different date immediately refreshes to show that date's attendance data
4. **Mode Changes**: Switching between daily and period modes refreshes with appropriate data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Subject and period changes in period mode immediately refresh the attendance data

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Fresh Day Test**: Open staff attendance screen on a new day - should show all students as absent
2. **Existing Data Test**: Take attendance, close screen, reopen - should show the attendance you just marked
3. **Date Navigation Test**: Change dates using date picker - should show correct data for each date
4. **Mode Switching Test**: Toggle between daily and period modes - should refresh appropriately
5. **Period Selection Test**: In period mode, change subject/period - should load correct existing data

This fix ensures that faculty always see accurate, current attendance data rather than stale defaults, improving the reliability of the attendance tracking system.
