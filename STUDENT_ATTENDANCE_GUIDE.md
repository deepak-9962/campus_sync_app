# Student Attendance Linking System

## Overview
This update implements automatic student attendance viewing by linking user accounts with student records. Students no longer need to manually enter their registration number every time they want to view their attendance.

## New Features

### 1. Automatic Student Detection
- Students are automatically identified by their linked user account
- No manual registration number input required
- Seamless attendance viewing experience

### 2. Account Linking System
- Students can link their user account with their student registration
- One-time setup process
- Secure linking with validation

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Beautiful attendance summary with percentage visualization
- Color-coded attendance status (Green: >85%, Orange: 75-85%, Red: <75%)
- Detailed statistics and progress indicators

## Database Changes

### New SQL Files
1. **`add_student_user_link.sql`** - Adds user_id column and linking functions
2. **`test_student_linking.sql`** - Test script for the linking functionality

### Key Changes
- Added `user_id` column to `students` table
- Created linking functions for secure account association
- Updated RLS policies for proper access control

## New Screens

### 1. StudentAttendanceScreen
- **Purpose**: Display student's personal attendance automatically
- **Features**: 
  - Attendance percentage with visual indicator
  - Statistics breakdown (total, present, absent classes)
  - Status warnings for low attendance
  - Student information display

### 2. LinkStudentAccountScreen
- **Purpose**: Allow students to link their account with registration number
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly linking interface
  - Validation and error handling
  - Instructions and guidance
  - One-time setup process

## How It Works

### For Students (First Time)
1. Student logs in and clicks "Check My Attendance"
2. If not linked, they're taken to the linking screen
3. Student enters their registration number
4. System validates and links the account
5. Student is redirected to their attendance view

### For Students (After Linking)
1. Student logs in and clicks "Check My Attendance"
2. System automatically detects their registration number
3. Attendance data is displayed immediately
4. No manual input required

### For Staff/Admin
- Can manually link student accounts using SQL functions
- Can view and manage all student attendance records
- Access to bulk linking capabilities

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Execute add_student_user_link.sql
```

### 2. Test the System
```sql
-- Run test_student_linking.sql to verify setup
-- Add test students if needed
-- Test linking functionality
```

### 3. Production Setup
1. Ensure all existing students are in the database
2. Students perform one-time account linking
3. Staff can assist with manual linking if needed

## Functions Available

### For Students
- `link_my_student_account(registration_no)` - Link own account

### For Admin/Faculty
- `link_student_with_user(registration_no, email)` - Link any student account

## Security Features
- RLS policies ensure students only see their own data
- Validation prevents duplicate account linking
- Secure function execution with proper permissions
- Authentication required for all operations

## User Experience Improvements
- No repeated registration number entry
- Visual attendance indicators
- Clear status messages
- Responsive design
- Error handling with helpful messages

## Navigation Updates
- Students: Home → Check My Attendance → Auto-display personal attendance
- Staff: Home → Take Attendance / View Attendance → Staff interface
- Seamless role-based navigation
