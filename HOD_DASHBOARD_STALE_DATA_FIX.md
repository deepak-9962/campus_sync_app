# HOD Dashboard Stale Data Bug Fix

## Problem Description
The HOD Dashboard (`lib/screens/hod_dashboard_screen.dart`) was displaying stale attendance statistics from previous days instead of fetching and showing live attendance data for the current date. This was causing confusion for HODs who expected to see real-time attendance information.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong Service Method**: The dashboard was calling `getDepartmentSummary()` which fetches **overall historical** attendance data instead of today's data
2. **Missing Date Filtering**: No proper date filtering was applied to ensure fresh current-day data
3. **No Data Clearing**: Old data wasn't being cleared before loading new data
4. **Service Separation**: HOD-specific functionality was mixed with general attendance service methods

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced HOD Service (`lib/services/hod_service.dart`)
Added comprehensive HOD-specific methods with proper date filtering:

#### `getDepartmentAttendanceSummary(String department, {DateTime? date})`
- Fetches **today's** department-wide attendance summary
- Uses `daily_attendance` table with explicit date filtering: `.eq('date', dateStr)`
- Returns live metrics: total students, present, absent, percentage for the specified date
- Handles department name variations (e.g., "Computer Science Engineering")

#### `getTodaySemesterWiseData(String department, {int? selectedSemester, DateTime? date})`
- Loads semester-wise attendance data for the specified date
- Supports filtering by specific semester or loading all semesters
- Uses AttendanceService's existing methods but ensures date-specific data

#### `getTodayLowAttendanceStudents(String department, {int? selectedSemester, DateTime? date, double threshold})`
- Identifies students with low attendance for the specified date
- Configurable threshold (default 75%)
- Date-aware filtering to show today's low attendance cases

### 2. Refactored HOD Dashboard Screen (`lib/screens/hod_dashboard_screen.dart`)

#### State Management Improvements
- **Added Data Clearing**: `_clearData()` method clears stale data before loading fresh data
- **Date Tracking**: Added `currentDate` variable to track which date's data is being displayed
- **Fresh Data Loading**: Modified `_loadDepartmentData()` to always fetch current date data

#### Enhanced User Interface
- **Date Selector**: Added calendar icon in AppBar to select different dates
- **Date Display**: Shows current date in AppBar subtitle for clarity
- **Manual Refresh**: Refresh button to reload data on demand
- **Loading State**: Proper loading indicators during data fetch

#### Service Integration
- **HOD Service Usage**: Switched from AttendanceService to HODService for all dashboard data
- **Date-aware Calls**: All service calls now pass the current date parameter
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages mentioning "fresh data"

## Technical Changes

### Key Method Modifications

**Before (Buggy)**:
```dart
// Used general attendance service with historical data
final summary = await _attendanceService.getDepartmentSummary(widget.department);
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```dart
// Uses HOD service with explicit date filtering
final summary = await _hodService.getDepartmentAttendanceSummary(
  widget.department,
  date: currentDate, // Always current or selected date
);
```

### Database Query Improvements
**HOD Service now uses proper date filtering**:
```dart
final todayAttendance = await _supabase
    .from('daily_attendance')
    .select('registration_no, is_present')
    .eq('date', dateStr) // ← Explicit date filtering
    .inFilter('registration_no', registrationNumbers);
```

### State Management Enhancements
```dart
void _clearData() {
  setState(() {
    departmentSummary = {};
    semesterWiseData = [];
    lowAttendanceStudents = [];
    isLoading = true;
  });
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Fresh Data on Load**: Dashboard shows today's attendance data when opened
2. **Date Selection**: HODs can select different dates to view historical data
3. **Real-time Refresh**: Manual refresh button provides latest data
4. **Clear Date Context**: AppBar shows which date's data is currently displayed
5. **No Stale Data**: Old data is cleared before loading new data

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Fresh Session**: Open HOD dashboard → should show today's data
2. **Date Navigation**: Select different date → should show that date's data
3. **Manual Refresh**: Click refresh button → should reload current date's data
4. **Data Accuracy**: Compare with staff attendance records → should match
5. **No Attendance Day**: Select date with no attendance → should show 0 present

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/services/hod_service.dart`**
   - Added `getDepartmentAttendanceSummary()` with date filtering
   - Added `getTodaySemesterWiseData()` for semester-wise current data
   - Added `getTodayLowAttendanceStudents()` for today's low attendance
   - Import AttendanceService for semester-specific operations

2. **`lib/screens/hod_dashboard_screen.dart`**
   - Switched to HODService from AttendanceService
   - Added date tracking and selection functionality
   - Enhanced AppBar with date display and selection
   - Improved state management with data clearing
   - Updated all data loading to be date-aware

This fix ensures HODs always see accurate, up-to-date attendance information for the date they're interested in, eliminating the confusion caused by stale historical data.
