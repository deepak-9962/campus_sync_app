```

#### 2. **Semester-wise Breakdown**
- Click on any semester (1st to 8th year)
- See all students in that semester
- Individual attendance percentages  
- Section-wise statistics

#### 3. **Low Attendance Alerts**
- Automatic list of students below 75% attendance
- Red-flagged for immediate attention
- Shows registration numbers for easy identification

### 🔐 Security & Privacy
- **HOD role**: Only sees assigned department data
- **Cannot see other departments**: Proper security boundaries
- **Read-only access**: Cannot accidentally modify attendance records

## 🚀 Setup Steps (Technical Implementation)

### Step 1: Database Setup
```bash
# Run this SQL script in Supabase
# File: sql files/create_hod_role_and_permissions.sql
```

### Step 2: Create HOD Account
```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard > Table Editor > users table
-- Add new user with:
role = 'hod'
assigned_department = 'Computer Science Engineering'
name = 'Dr. [HOD Name]'
email = '[hod email]'
```

### Step 3: Access HOD Dashboard
1. Login with HOD credentials
2. Home Screen → "HOD Dashboard" (appears automatically)
3. View department-wide statistics

## 📱 How HOD Will Use It

### Daily Monitoring:
1. **Open HOD Dashboard**
2. **Check Today's Summary**: See present/absent counts
3. **Review Low Attendance**: Students needing attention
4. **Semester Analysis**: Deep dive into specific semesters

### Weekly/Monthly Reviews:
1. **Trend Analysis**: Track improvement/decline
2. **Section Comparison**: Compare Section A vs B performance  
3. **Intervention Planning**: Contact low-attendance students

## 🆚 Staff Access vs HOD Access

### Staff Users See:
- ✅ Their own class attendance only
- ✅ Students they teach
- ✅ Mark attendance for their subjects

### HOD Users See:
- ✅ **Entire department** attendance overview
- ✅ **All semesters** (1st to 8th year)
- ✅ **All sections** (A, B, C, etc.)
- ✅ **Department statistics** and analytics
- ✅ **Cross-subject attendance** patterns

## 💡 Why Not Make It Transparent to All Staff?

### ❌ Problems with Full Transparency:
1. **Privacy Violation**: Staff seeing students they don't teach
2. **Data Overload**: Irrelevant information for most staff
3. **Security Risk**: Too many people with broad access
4. **Role Confusion**: Who's responsible for department oversight?

### ✅ Benefits of HOD-Only Access:
1. **Proper Hierarchy**: Department oversight = HOD responsibility
2. **Focused Data**: HOD sees what they need to manage
3. **Privacy Protection**: Student data on need-to-know basis
4. **Clear Accountability**: HOD manages department performance
